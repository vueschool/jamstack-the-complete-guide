In the early days of the web, html files served from static servers were the basis of most websites. Today, many websites are generated on demand by powerful backends, as pages are requested. The latter approach has led to many benefits but also led to issues with security, performance, complexity, and cost.

What if you could have the best of both worlds? That’s where the JamStack enters the picture. The JamStack architecture is a modern approach that capitalizes on the power of JavaScript in the client and powerful site generators that output static html. The approach keeps sites dynamic and feature rich, while making them cheap, simple, and performant to host and serve.

Perhaps, best of all, if you’re interested in working with the JamStack, you have a wealth of options available as far as frameworks, static site generators, and programming languages are concerned.

In this course, dive into the Jamstack with Nuxt.js. This powerful meta-framework built on top of Vue.js, means working with technologies you’re already familiar with and getting static site generation support for free.

We’ll also utilize the top ranked CMS Storyblok, to act as a headless CMS for the statically generated site. It includes features such as:

- an intuitive developer API
- live site previews that update as content creators type
- and support for draft and published content

By the end of the course, you’ll have hands on experience building a site for the JamStack that clearly doesn’t skimp on features and content management while still being simple, cheap, performant, and secure.
